This is a simple HTML project that uses Bootstrap for styling and interactivity.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file. Includes references to the Bootstrap CSS and JS files, as well as the custom CSS and JS files.
- `css/style.css`: Custom CSS file for additional styles or to override Bootstrap's default styles.
- `js/script.js`: Custom JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the website.
- `lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`: Minified Bootstrap CSS file.
- `lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js`: Minified Bootstrap JS file.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.
2. Edit `css/style.css` and `js/script.js` to add custom styles and interactivity.
3. Add or modify HTML in `index.html` as needed.

## Note

Make sure to always include the Bootstrap CSS file before any custom CSS files and the Bootstrap JS file before any custom JS files.
